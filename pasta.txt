If you don't have an oven, here's a recipe for a stovetop potato and pasta skillet with a cheesy egg topping:

Ingredients:
- 1 pound pasta
- 4-5 potatoes, peeled and sliced
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 cups cottage cheese
- 1 cup grated cheese (cheddar or mozzarella work well)
- 4 eggs
- 2 slices of bread, cubed
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. Drain and set aside.

2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the sliced potatoes and cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are golden brown and tender.

3. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the potatoes and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, until the onion is softened.

4. Add the halved cherry tomatoes to the skillet with the potatoes and onions and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, until the tomatoes are softened.

5. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, cottage cheese, and cornstarch until well combined.

6. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the potato mixture and stir well.

7. Pour the egg and cottage cheese mixture over the pasta and potato mixture and spread it evenly over the top.

8. Sprinkle the grated cheese over the egg mixture, followed by the cubed bread.

9. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook over low heat for 20-25 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the casserole is hot and bubbly.

10. Serve hot and enjoy!

This stovetop version of the recipe is just as delicious as the baked version and can be made quickly and easily without the need for an oven. The key is to cook the potatoes and onions slowly to allow them to caramelize and release their sweet flavors.
